# reveal-js-demo-slides

Some Clojure source for generating demo slides for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Usage

Check out our `reveal.js` with the Server Side Include support:

        $ git clone https://github.com/cassiel/reveal.js

(Hopefully that will make its way into the main release.) If you're on a Mac, that should probably go into `~/Sites`.

Check out this project as a submodule:

        $ cd [...]/reveal.js
        $ ...
